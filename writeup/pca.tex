\section{Introduction}
In total three papers are reviewed to compare the advantages and disadvantages of different machine learning techniques in the use for Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention system.

The papers under reviewing are listed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Principal Component Analysis
	\item Linear Discriminant Analysis 
	\item Fernandes, et al. \cite{fernandes2016network}
\end{itemize}

\section{PCA}
The sheer size of the network traffic data in the modern age is not only a challenge for computer hardware but also a main bottleneck for the performance of many machine learning algorithms. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a simple yet popular and useful linear transformation technique that is used in numerous applications, such as stock market predictions, the analysis of gene expression data, and many more. In this thesis we will use it to analyse the huge amount of network traffic data for network security purpose. 

The main goal of a PCA analysis is to identify patterns in data; PCA aims to detect the correlation between variables. If a strong correlation between variables exists, the attempt to reduce the dimensionality only makes sense. In a nutshell, this is what PCA is all about: Finding the directions of maximum variance in high-dimensional data and project it onto a smaller dimensional subspace while retaining most of the information.

	\item Careful, PCA does SVD on the covariance matrix, LSA does it on the data matrix directly.

\subsection{PCA and Dimensionality Reduction}
Often, the desired goal is to reduce the dimensions of a \textbf{d}-dimensional dataset by projecting it onto a (\textbf{k})-dimensional subspace (where $\textbf{k} < \textbf{d}$) in order to increase the computational efficiency while retaining most of the information.

In Chapter 4, we will compute eigenvectors (the principal components) of the network traffic dataset and collect them in a projection matrix. Each of those eigenvectors is associated with an eigenvalue which can be interpreted as the “length” or “magnitude” of the corresponding eigenvector. If some eigenvalues have a significantly larger magnitude than others that the reduction of the dataset via PCA onto a smaller dimensional subspace by dropping the “less informative” eigenpairs is reasonable.


\subsection{A Summary of the PCA Approach}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Standardize the data.
	\item Obtain the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues from the covariance matrix or correlation matrix, or perform Singular Vector Decomposition.
	\item Sort eigenvalues in descending order and choose the \textbf{k} eigenvectors that correspond to the kk largest eigenvalues where \textbf{k} is the number of dimensions of the new feature subspace (\textbf{k} $\leqslant$ \textbf{d}).
	\item Construct the projection matrix \textbf{W} from the selected kk eigenvectors.
	\item Transform the original dataset \textbf{X} via \textbf{W} to obtain a \textbf{k}-dimensional feature subspace \textbf{Y}.
\end{itemize}


%One technique to select features is using some ranking criteria to rank features for example: 
%1) Correlation Criteria: with this criteria you can rank features in order of their correlation with the labels of the data.
%
%2)Mutual Information Criteria: high mutual information of a feature with the label means high relevance of that feature. 
%
%Another technique is Wrapper methods.


\section{LDA}
The Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is the core of the Eigenfaces method, finds a linear combination of features that maximizes the total variance in data. While this is clearly a powerful way to represent data, it doesn’t consider any classes and so a lot of discriminative information may be lost when throwing components away.

\section{PCA vs. LDA}
Both Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and PCA are linear transformation methods. PCA yields the directions (principal components) that maximize the variance of the data, whereas LDA also aims to find the directions that maximize the separation (or discrimination) between different classes, which can be useful in pattern classification problem (PCA “ignores” class labels). 

In other words, PCA projects the entire dataset onto a different feature (sub)space, and LDA tries to determine a suitable feature (sub)space in order to distinguish between patterns that belong to different classes.

\section{Cloud Computing}
\subsection{A Survey of Security and Privacy Challenges in Cloud Computing}
Cloud computing is defined as a service model that
enables convenient, on-demand network access to a large
shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g.,
networks, servers, storage, applications, and services)
that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal
management effort or service provider interaction \cite{nistcc}.

This innovative information system architecture, which is
fundamentally changing the way that computing, storage
and networking resources are allocated and managed,
brings numerous advantages to users, including but not
limited to reduced capital costs, easy access to information,
improved flexibility, automatic service integration, and quick deployment \cite{ccreally}

\subsection{Challenges}
The paper identifies several specific security challenges in cloud computing which require the development of advanced security technology.

\begin{description}
	\item [Loss of Control] refers to the situation that cloud users’ control over their data is diminished when they move the data from their own local servers to remote cloud servers. A great number of concerns about
	data protection are raised
	\item [Lack of Transparency] indicates the conflict interests between the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and Cloud Service Users (CSUs).
	\item [Virtualization Related Issues] includes New Access Context, Attacks against Hypervisor etc.
	\item[Multi-Tenancy Related Issues] Multi-tenancy is defined as “the practice of placing multiple tenants on the same physical hardware to reduce costs to the user by leveraging economies of scale”\cite{brown2012multi}. It indicates sharing of computational resources, storage, services and applications with other tenants, hosted by the same physical or logical platform at the provider’s premises.
	\item [Managerial Issues] Most cloud-specific security and privacy challenges have their own managerial aspect, including Loss of control, the lack of transparency challenge as well as the malicious insider challenge. The fact that managerial challenges are overarching
	and add to the other challenges is what makes it one of the toughest challenges to deal with.
\end{description}

\subsection{Existing Solutions}
Diverse defense studies have been launched to secure the cloud computing environment. The state-of-the-art researches that aims to
address the security issues in cloud computing are summaries in the following section.

\begin{description}
	\item[Encryption Algorithms] At the current stage, encryption is still the major solution for addressing data confidentiality issues in cloud
	computing
	\item[Access Control] Access control, consisting of authentication, authorization, and accounting, is a way of ensuring that the access
	is provided only to the authorized users, hence the data is stored in a secure manner
	\item[Third Party Auditing] CSUs and CSPs are not involved in the auditing process except for providing data and information for the independent auditors. TPA can be used to relieve the concerns on data integrity,	confidentiality, availability, and privacy. TPA can
	examine at least two aspects of data integrity: while data is in transit and while it is stationary.
	\item[Isolation] Current studies handle isolation from several aspects.
	1) Hypervisors or virtual machine monitor (VMM), a
	piece of computer software, firmware or hardware that
	creates and runs virtual machines, can be utilized to facilitate
	isolation. 2) Some software-level resource management mechanisms
	are proposed to perform isolation for cache, disk, memory bandwidth, and network. 3) Hardware-level solutions are proposed to allocate memory
	bandwidth and processor caches in a better way. 4) Strict mechanisms to separate customer data are required by cloud users . 5) Security models are established	to ensure isolation.
	\item[Soft Trust Solutions] Trust has been identified as one promising approach to address security and privacy issues in cloud computing. Specifically, ‘soft’ trust is defined as the relationship between two parties	for a specific action or property. Diverse trust models have been proposed to evaluate the trustworthiness of a CSP.
	\item[Hard Trust Solutions] In the cloud computing model, customer views are limited to a virtual infrastructure typically built on top of
	non-trusted physical hardware or operating environments.
	Hardware-based security solutions are envisioned as a
	natural trend that a CSP will be likely to follow in coming
	years to resolve different data privacy and integrity issues
	\item[Governance] Governance refers to a comprehensive set of activities
	associated with planning and implementing controls. In
	the context of cloud security, there are some initial signs of a cloud-specific security governance
	framework emerging.
