\section{Time and Work}

\subsection{Summary}
Lunch time, plan to work about 2 hours on the project. Primarily reading. Will also test the Matlab codes for first time - that's the plan!
\begin{itemize}
	\item Background reading about cloud computing and network security papers that client has downloaded
	\item The original write-ups in the current version on ML algorithms is poor, very very poor. Plan to improve upon PCA, LDA and mainly focus on their differences to argue for the proposed method eventually
	\item Run Matlab demos if possible - bought personal licence for less than USD 200 (incl. Image Processing and Computer Vision toolbox) 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Time and work breakdowns}
\begin{description}
	\item [12:15 - 12:30]:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item No feature selection
		\item No feature dimensionality reduction
	\end{itemize}	 
	\item [ACO for Feature Selection \cite{aghdam2016feature}]:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item No feature dimensionality reduction
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item[15:15 - 16:15]:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{15:15 - 15:20}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Downloaded 10 cloud computing papers from the client. Modified all file names so easier to refer in future.
				\item quickly identified 4 papers, simply by the title for quick reading.
				\item This is just the background reading. The goal is to understand the Computing Cloud concepts and more important how to write up properly for ML methods.
				\item Starts from two survey papers
			\end{itemize}
		\item 15:20 - 15:55
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Read first survey paper. Make notes.
		\end{itemize} 
		 
	\end{itemize}
\end{description}
